title: Microencapsulation and Application of Probiotic Bacteria Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v Strain
---

Microencapsulation is an up-and-coming technology for maintaining the viability of probiotics. 
However, the effect of core-to-wall ratios and ratios of polysaccharides on the protection of 
the *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* 299v strain has not been deeply discussed. Lyophilization of the 
*Lp. plantarum* 299v strain was conducted, and different core-to-wall ratios and ratios of maltodextrin (MD) 
and resistant starch (RS) were applied. Results demonstrated that the content of MD and RS had an influence 
on the yield and bulk density in both core-to-wall ratios (1:1 and 1:1.5). In addition, samples coated with 
a core-to-wall ratio of 1:1.5 had significantly higher viability than those coated with a core-to-wall 
ratio of 1:1. Moreover, samples coated with core-to-wall ratios of 1:1 and MD:RS 1:1, as well as core-to-wall 
ratios of 1:1.5 and MD:RS 3:1, had the highest cell number after simulated gastric fluid and simulated 
intestinal fluid testing, respectively. Furthermore, the optimal formulation for the application of microencapsulated 
*Lp. plantarum* 299v in apple juice (serving as a functional beverage) is listed as follows: core-to-wall 
ratios of 1:1 and MD:RS 1:1, with the fortification method, and stored at 4 Â°C. After 11 weeks of storage, 
the cell count was 8.28 log (CFU/mL). This study provided a strategy for *Lp. plantarum* 299v to achieve 
high viability in long-term storage and provides an application in functional apple beverages.
