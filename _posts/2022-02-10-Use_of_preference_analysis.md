title: Use of Preference Analysis to Identify Early Adopter Mind-Sets of Insect-Based Food Products
---

Insects may potentially provide an alternative protein source. However, consumers may not easily accept insects due to 
feelings of disgust. Therefore, identifying early adopters of insectbased food products may determine their future acceptance. 
This study was conducted to (1) identify early adopter Mind-Sets of insect-based food products, (2) determine product features 
early adopters would prefer in an insect-based food product, and (3) determine differences in Mind-Sets in different countries. 
Two studies were distributed online in the US and the Philippines. The first study included information about insects, 
while the second study had no information on insects. The experimental design included elements, or product features, 
regarding insect-based products that participants evaluated. Preference Analysis was used to segment the participants into Mind-Sets. 
Based on the results, participants neither liked nor disliked the elements used. Participants in the studies 
without insect information were found to have higher liking when comparing liking. Participants who were aware of the study 
being about insects may have had less interest when evaluating the elements, as the response times between the US studies were 
significantly different (*p* < 0.05). The role of information and segmentation of the participants demonstrates the importance of 
experimental design when using Preference Analysis.
