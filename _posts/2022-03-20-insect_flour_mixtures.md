title: Analysis of wheat flour-insect powder mixtures based on their near infrared spectra
---

Insects are gaining more and more space in food and feed sectors, creating an intense scientific interest 
towards insects as food ingredients. Several papers deal with cereal-based products complemented by insect powder 
in the past few years. However, adulteration and quality control of such products present some hot topics for researchers, 
e.g., how can we justify the amounts and/or species of the insects used in the given products? Our paper aims to answer 
such questions by analysing seven edible insect powders of different species independently. The mixtures with wheat flour 
were analysed using near infrared spectroscopy and chemometric methods. Not only powders of different species were clearly 
differentiated, but also mixtures created by different amounts of wheat flour. Prediction of insect content showed 
0.65% cross-validated error. The proposed methodology gives an excellent tool for quality control of insect-based cereal food products.
