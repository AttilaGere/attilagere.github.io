title: Sensory analysis and consumer mind-sets and emotions for dairy products
---

Mind Genomics is an actionable, scalable and empirical means to discover what to say, 
how to say it and to whom. This chapter presents a systematic approach to understanding 
consumer attitudes and emotions about statements regarding one prominent category of dairy products: cheese. 
In principle, the same approach can be applied to any of the many dairy products commercially available. 
We present data from US consumers, showing a method to uncover the responses to the meaning of vignettes 
about cheese, and in turn deconstructing the responses to contributions about the individual messages or 
elements. We generalise the approach to deal with emotional responses to these same vignettes, specifically 
the degree of linkage between each emotion and each message or element. The results reveal specifics about 
the mind of the consumer regarding cheese, specifics and mind-sets that might not otherwise be revealed through 
more direct questionnaires.
