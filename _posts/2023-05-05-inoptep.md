The VIII International Conference on Sustainable Postharvest and

Conference on Processing and Energy in Agriculture (PTEP 2023) were held 
jointly from April 23 to 28, 2023, at Lake PaliÄ‡, near Subotica, Serbia.
The conference was co-organized and supported by the ISEKI-Food Association, 
along with national institutions such as the Institute of Food Technology in Novi Sad,

Vegetable Crops, the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad, and the Faculty of

I was invited as a plenary lecturer and delivered a presentation on the application of 
multicriteria decision making methods in food sciences. The program enabled us to build
networks and to saw the seeds of further collaborations.
