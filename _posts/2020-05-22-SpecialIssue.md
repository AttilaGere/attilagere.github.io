title: Special Issue "Sustainability in Sensory Analysis and New Food Product Development"
---

Dear Colleagues,

Over the past decades, sustainability gained more and more space in food sciences and therefore in food sensory analysis 
and product development, too. In order to feed the ever-growing population of planet Earth, not only new food ingredients 
must be developed but new, greener food technologies, raw materials, sensory testing methods and deeper understanding of 
consumer minds regarding innovations are needed. There are several promising research directions including cultured meats, 
insects as food, plant-based protein sources, minimal processing technologies, food waste reduction, new sensory methods 
suitable for testing children’s food preferences, rapid sensory methods, and consumer attitude evaluations, all pointing to 
the global aim of preserving Earth’s resources while providing quality food for the population.

This Special Issue will comprise a selection of papers presenting original and innovative contributions to the 
sustainability in sensory analysis and new food product development in areas related to new food ingredients, 
greener food technologies, raw materials, sensory testing methods and deeper understanding of consumer minds 
regarding innovations in food sciences that will contribute to a more sustainable future of food industry. 
Papers selected for this Special Issue will be subject to a rigorous peer-review process with the aim of rapid 
and wide dissemination of research results, developments, and applications.

Sustainability is an open access MDPI journal, with an impact factor of 2.592 (Q2 on Scimago).
