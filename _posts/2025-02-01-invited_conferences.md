title: Plenary speaker at Pálinka konferencia 2022
---

I was invited as a Plenary speaker at Pálinka konferencia in 2022, where I presented the 
opportunities in the applications of novel consumer sensory methods in pálinka sensory analysis.
The lecture introduced some of the latest restuls we achieved with students enrolled to the 
Pálinka szakmérnöki course of MATE university. It has been proved that pálinka consumers are willing
to attend on consumer sensory tests and the latest methods, such as check-all-that apply analyses,
preference mapping or even modeling give valuable information to pálinka makers to meet the
expectations of consumers.
