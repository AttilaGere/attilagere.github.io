title: Multicriteria decision making for evergreen problems in food science by sum of ranking differences
---

Finding optimal solutions usually requires multicriteria optimization. The sum of ranking differences (SRD) algorithm can 
efficiently solve such problems. Its principles and earlier applications will be discussed here, along with meta-analyses of 
papers published in various subfields of food science, such as analytics in food chemistry, food engineering, food technology, 
food microbiology, quality control, and sensory analysis. Carefully selected real case studies give an overview of 
the wide range of applications for multicriteria optimizations, using a free, easy-to-use and validated method. 
Results are presented and discussed in a way that helps scientists and practitioners, who are less familiar with 
multicriteria optimization, to integrate the method into their research projects. The utility of SRD, optionally coupled with 
other statistical methods such as ANOVA, is demonstrated on altogether twelve case studies, covering diverse method comparison and 
data evaluation scenarios from various subfields of food science.
