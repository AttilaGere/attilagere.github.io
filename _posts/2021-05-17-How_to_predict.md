title: How to predict choice using eye-movements data?
---

In recent decades, eye-movement detection technology has improved significantly, 
and eye-trackers are available not only as standalone research tools but also as computer peripherals. 
This rapid spread gives further opportunities to measure the eye-movements of participants. 
The current paper provides classification models for the prediction of food choice and selects the best one. 
Four choice sets were presented to 112 volunteered participants, each choice set consisting of four different 
choice tasks, resulting in altogether sixteen choice tasks. The choice sets followed 
the 2-, 4-, 6- and 8-alternative forced-choice paradigm. Tobii X2-60 eye-tracker and 
Tobii Studio software were used to capture and export gazing data, respectively. After variable filtering, 
thirteen classification models were elaborated and tested; moreover, eight performance parameters were computed. 
The models were compared based on the performance parameters using the sum of ranking differences algorithm. 
The algorithm ranks and groups the models by comparing the ranks of their performance metrics to 
a predefined gold standard. Techniques based on decision trees were superior in all cases, regardless 
of the choice tasks and food product categories. Among the classifiers, Quinlan's C4.5 and cost-sensitive 
decision trees proved to be the best-performing ones. Future studies should focus on the fine-tuning of 
these models as well as their applications with mobile eye-trackers.
