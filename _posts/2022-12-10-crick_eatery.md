title: The Crick-Eatery. A Novel Approach to Evaluate Cricket (Acheta domesticus) Powder Replacement in Food Products through Product Eating Experience and Emotional Response
---

This study was conducted to evaluate three different food products containing cricket powder for consumer acceptability, 
emotional response, satiety, and plate waste. US untrained consumers (*n* = 108), from the San Luis Obispo, CA area, 
were recruited to evaluate three food products (sausage, pasta, and brownies) as components in a three-course meal that 
either contain cricket powder (CP) or not (Control). The CP sausage was found to have lower liking scores than 
the Control for the attributes tested (*p* < 0.05). The CP pasta was found to be higher in overall liking than 
the Control (*p* < 0.05). The CP Brownies were rated highly across the attributes, except for texture and aftertaste (*p* < 0.05). 
Though the CP products were found to be as acceptable as the Controls, the use of cricket powder may have affected 
the texture and flavor profile of both the CP sausage and brownies. The participants selected more positive emotions terms 
for both the CP and Control products than negative emotions. Negative terms selected, such as worried, decreased once 
the products were consumed (*p* < 0.05). Plate waste and subjective satiety may also be indicators of consumer acceptability. 
Significant correlations were found between appearance liking and satiety as well as taste liking and plate waste for both 
the Control and CP products/dishes (*p* < 0.05). Based on this work, future acceptance of insect-based products may be 
encouraged by evaluating the products throughout an eating experience.
