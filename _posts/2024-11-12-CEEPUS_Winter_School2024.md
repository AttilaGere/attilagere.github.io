I was invited as a Chairperson and presenter at CEEPUS Winter School 2024 organized at
BOKU University, Institute of Chemical and Energy Engineering (IVET). I presented a 
lecture to students and interested colleagues on the Eye-tracking
from design to data analysis. The Winter School provided a platform for exchanging ideas, 
forging new partnerships, and exploring innovative solutions for enhancing educational 
and research initiatives within networks 
RS-1512-05-2425 - Improving Food Quality with Novel Food Processing Technologies
and RS-1012-00-2425 - Building Knowledge and Experience Exchange in CFD.
Looking forward to the next opportunity to meet this extraordinary community.
