title: Effect of Scents on Gazing Behavior and Choice
---

Environmental stimuli can have a significant impact on our decisions. Elements of the store atmosphere, 
such as music, lights and smells, all have effects on choices, but these have been only vaguely investigated. 
In the present study, we aim to uncover the effect of strawberry scent on the gazing behavior and choices of 
the 62 recruited participants. A static eye-tracker was used to study the effect of scent, released by a diffuser. 
In total, 31 participants completed the study under odorless conditions, while another 31 participants had 
strawberry fragrance sprayed into the air. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine whether the most 
gazed-upon product in each of the four categories (chocolate, tea, muesli bar, yoghurt) was chosen, (2) whether 
the presence of the strawberry scent influenced consumer decision making, i.e., whether the strawberry scent 
influenced more people to choose strawberry-flavored products, and (3) to introduce the application of a fast and 
easy-to-use technique for the qualitative analysis of strawberry aroma present in the air during eye-tracking measurements. 
The results show that (1) participants chose the product they had studied the longest, for all four categories, 
and (2) the presence or absence of the scent had no significant effect on choice, with the same frequencies of choosing 
each product in the two conditions regardless of the flavor of the products.
