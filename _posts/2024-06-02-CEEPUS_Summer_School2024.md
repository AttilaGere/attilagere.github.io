I was invited as a presenter at CEEPUS Summer School 2024 organized at
BOKU University, Institute of Chemical and Energy Engineering (IVET) 
between 02 May 2024 and 08 May 2024. I presented a 
lecture to students and interested colleagues on hierarchical clustering. 
The Summer School provided a platform for exchanging ideas, forging new 
partnerships, and exploring innovative solutions for enhancing educational 
and research initiatives within networks 
RS-1512-05-2425 - Improving Food Quality with Novel Food Processing Technologies
and RS-1012-00-2425 - Building Knowledge and Experience Exchange in CFD.
Looking forward to the next opportunity to meet this extraordinary community.
