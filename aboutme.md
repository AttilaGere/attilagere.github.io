### Short bio

Dr. Attila Gere is a food sensory scientist. His research focuses mainly on 
consumer sensory analysis including but not limited to novel (e.g., insect-based) 
food product and sensory/sensometric method developments. He has a strong focus on 
novel technologies, such as eye-tracking, face reading, virtual/mixed reality, and 
emotional responses to food products. These technologies help to solve problems 
related to sustainability in the food sector, therefore contributing to SDG #2. 
He is a member of a vivid international community of food scientists and is always 
open to new challenges. Attila currently lives in Budapest with his family and 
actively practices fatherhood.
